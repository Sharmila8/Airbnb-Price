Project Description
-------------------

This is a small project to analyse and model prices of Airbnb listings. 44 variables are scraped from 900 listings in three cities. A regression model will be built to assess the effects of the variables on the listing price, following which a predictive model based on either the regression or a different algorithm will be constructed.

Status
------

The requisite data has been obtained. I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data. The code is stored in an iPython notebook (Airbnb Listings Scraper.ipynb) now available in this repository. The scraped data is also available as a pickled list of dictionaries (airbnb_data.pkl).
